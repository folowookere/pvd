            <br></br>
            <p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro,sans-serif; font-size:1rem; color:#6a6a6a;">March 26, 2018</p>
            <p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro,sans-serif; font-size:1rem; color:#6a6a6a;"><em>Citing Need for Additional Community Engagement and Public Input</em></p>
<p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro,sans-serif; font-size:1rem; color:#6a6a6a;">PROVIDENCE, RI – Today, Mayor Jorge Elorza, vetoed an ordinance  amending Chapter 12, &ldquo;Health and Sanitation,&rdquo; of the Code of Ordinances  of the City of Providence to Establish Section 20, &ldquo;Reduction of  Single-Use Checkout Bags by Retail Establishments.&rdquo; This ordinance would  reduce single-use plastic bags in the City of Providence and after a  year period, require that &ldquo;any store that provides any type of checkout  bag shall sell them for no less than ten cents ($0.10) per bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro,sans-serif; font-size:1rem; color:#6a6a6a;"><a style="text-decoration:none;"  href="http://www.providenceri.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Single-Use-Plastic-Bag-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >In a letter to the members of the Providence City Council</a>,  Mayor Elorza warned of the negative impacts of plastic bags and the  merit of the policy goal. &ldquo;Single-use plastic bags are a hazard to human  health and our environment.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;They clog up our stormwater  infrastructure, pollute our neighborhoods and waterways, and introduce  harmful chemicals into our environment and bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro,sans-serif; font-size:1rem; color:#6a6a6a;">The Racial and Environmental Justice Committee (REJC) sent a letter  to Mayor Elorza and council members on March 14 and citied specific  concerns with the policy after their evaluation noting, &ldquo;This policy  assumes that everyone has equal access to reusable bags. That is not the  case for low income families who do not drive a car. Many community  members will struggle to pay the fee.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro,sans-serif; font-size:1rem; color:#6a6a6a;">Echoing concerns articulated by the REJC, Mayor Elorza requested that  more robust community engagement be done before he signs the ordinance  into law. Elorza continued, &ldquo;There is no harm done in taking our time to  do this right, but we do risk harm if we exclude or ignore these  communities and their concerns in this process.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro,sans-serif; font-size:1rem; color:#6a6a6a;">In a statement released today, Aaron Jaehnig, Chapter Chair, Sierra  Club, Rhode Island Chapter, offered support for Mayor Elorza&rsquo;s decision  to veto the measure:</p>
<p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro,sans-serif; font-size:1rem; color:#6a6a6a;">The Rhode Island Chapter of Sierra Club is in full support of the  City&rsquo;s efforts to reduce waste, pollution and the impacts of climate  change with a single-use plastic bag ban. However, we also recognize the  importance of having the most impacted communities thoroughly engaged  in the process and given a real opportunity to voice their concerns and  potential solutions.  While everyone agrees the bag ban is a huge step  in the right direction, the Mayor&rsquo;s veto will allow progress to occur  without skipping a step. It is a bold move to ensure the crafting of  city policy prioritizes equity, inclusion and justice. The world is  plagued with deep ecological and economic crises and the solution to one  type of problem should not create one of the other kind, both  disproportionately impacting working class communities of color. The  Racial and Environmental Justice Committee is specifically tasked with  ensuring the voices of black, indigenous, people of color are at the  center of sustainability conversations and we fully back the Mayor&rsquo;s  decision to support them and their request for further engagement with  the community.</p>
<p style="font-family:Source Sans Pro,sans-serif; font-size:1rem; color:#6a6a6a;">While citing concerns about the current ordinance, Mayor Elorza  reinforced his commitment to creating a policy that works for all  residents. &ldquo;I am confident that with more time for public discourse and  these voices centered in that process, we can come up with a plastic bag  policy that eliminates this environmental hazard from our community,  while not burdening our low-income residents. By being deliberate and  intentional about who is at the table, we can create an effective policy  that makes our communities stronger, rather than divide us. Once that  is done, I look forward to signing this into law.&rdquo;</p>
